# ATAC-seq analysis

A set of scripts to preprocess ATAC sequencing reads, align to genome, investigate for quality and perform downstream analysis including transcription factor footprinting and differential analysis.

(1) ATAC-seq preprocessing, alignment and peak calling.

(2) ATAC-seq peak calling.

(3) ATAC-seq transcription factor footprinting.

Peaking calling performed using MACS2 with parameters suited for ATAC-seq peak calling.

Footprinting analyses performed using the TOBIAS algorithm, with slight alterations to the default parameters.
